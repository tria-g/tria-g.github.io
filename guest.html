              A research study was conducted to improve the guest experience in the company, while at the same time introduce contactless biometrics to the building.  </p> 

              <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;"><b style="font-size:16px;color:black!important;" >Problem statement </b> <br>

              There was an idea to introduce facial recognition technology to the company building in order to enhance the building experience of employees and visitors. However, before proceeding with this change, a comprehensive review and research of the current experience, as well as the facial recognition technology itself, is necessary to identify any potential challenges and opportunities for improvement and ensure a successful implementation. This research should consider the latest advancements and best practices in facial recognition technology and its applications in similar environments.<br>


              
            <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;"><b style="font-size:16px;color:black!important;" > Role & audience</b> <br>
              As the lead Experience Designer for this project, I took the initiative to conduct in-depth research and analysis to propose improvements to the guest experience. My focus was to gather the necessary information and understanding of the current process to create a seamless experience for the key stakeholders, including guests, building concierge, and employees. The research I conducted included a study of the best practices and benefits of facial recognition technology and its applications in similar environments, as well as its utilization by other global companies. </p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;"><b style="font-size:16px;color:black!important;" >Process</b> <br>
              <b>Interviews and process review<br></b>
             Before delving into the adoption of the aforementioned technology, I needed to understand first what the current guest experience is. I interviewed both the process team that handles the current guest management as well as the building concierge, in order to know what is the expected experience vis a vis what is implemented. <br><br>

             I first conversed with the facility app team, who oversees the product used to manage the in and out of guests in the building. They explained the flow that starts with the employee inviting the guest then the guest does the pre-registration, so that upon arrival the just check-in quickly.

             <br><br>

             To further explore the current process, I also conducted interviews with the actual users to validate the current process explained by the product team. This was important to check if the imposed solution actually aligns with what the guests, building concierge, and employees, are currently experiencing. 

             <br><br>

            Notably, there were discrepancies in the defined and proposed processes. Hereâ€™s a diagram to make it easier to understand the misaslignment:


            <center><a href="img/gu.png" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Expectations vs reality of the guest experience"> <img class="img-fluid mb-4" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" src="img/gu.png" alt=""></a> <center><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="font-size: 12px;"><br>Expectations vs reality of the guest experience based on the interviews from the product team and actual concierge</center></center>

                     <br><br>
                <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">

           To add, the Building concierge personnel shared the following sentiments from their experiences:<br> <center>

               <img class="img-fluid mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" src="img/gu5.png" width="100%" alt=""></a> <center><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="font-size: 12px;"><br>Expectations vs reality of the guest experience based on the interviews from the product team and actual concierge</center>
</center>
                </p>

                </p>


           <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">


           The discrepancy between expectations and reality can lead to inefficiencies in the guest experience. When the actual experience falls short of the expectations, it can result in frustration, dissatisfaction, and decreased satisfaction for the guests. 

              

              <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;"><b> Time motion study</b>

              <br>To grasp a better understanding on the possible inefficiencies and its implications, I conducted a time-motion study on the current process. 

                <br>The time motion study conducted on a regular Monday revealed valuable insights into the check-in process for guests. On average, each guest took nearly 6 minutes to check-in, but this is just a baseline measurement. It's important to note that during events, the queueing time and process can become a bottleneck in the lobby, resulting in even longer delays for guests. Here is a short summary of the findings:

             <br> <br>

                 <center> <a href="img/gu2.png" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Time motion study results "> <img class="img-fluid mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" src="img/gu2.png" width="100%" alt=""></a> <center><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="font-size: 12px;"><br>Time motion study results conducted on a regular Monday in the office building</center>

              <div class="col-lg-6 mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;"><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">
              <b>Implications and risks<br></b>

              While 6 minutes may seem like a relatively short amount of time to check-in, there are significant implications and risks associated with a prolonged check-in process. In this particular case, it's worth noting that the implemented process is not the one that was initially intended, as having on-the-spot registrations can pose security risks. The original intention of pre-registrations is to make sure that the guests that arrive in the building are actually accounted for by the employees. Possible security breaches cannot be ignored as on-the-spot registrations can lead to unverified guests gaining access to the building.

              <br> <br>
              Furthermore, having guests queue up in close proximity for extended periods of time without knowing if they are cleared or not in the building poses health risks. The health check should be made prior to their arrival, to ensure they don't bring any infections to the office. These concerns were heavily taken into account during the creation of this study, which was conducted during the ongoing pandemic. <br><br>

              As the pandemic slowly subsides, the new normal still has drastically changed our perspective on health risks. It is become clear that crowded spaces and close proximity with others can pose a significant threat to public health. <br><br>

           As a result, it's become more important than ever to prioritize safety measures in all aspects of our daily lives, including in building hospitality and event management.  

              <br><br> Ultimately, these risks have necessitated a rethinking of traditional processes and the implementation of new technologies and procedures to ensure the safety and well-being of both guests and employees.

              <b><br>Introducing facial technology<br></b>

              Given that security and health risks are a common concern globally, I researched how other companies around the world respond to these, in order to find best practices that could be taken note of.
              <br> 
              <br>
              Through my research, it became clear how global companies are constantly seeking innovative solutions to mitigate security and health risks, and one common solution is contactless biometrics. Many well-known companies such as Canon, Intel, Marriott, and Google have implemented this technology to through facial or iris recognition. <br> <br>

            For instance, Canon has developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQFiDefLzlM"> <u>Visitor Management System</u></a>  for their office building that utilizes facial recognition to efficiently manage and monitor guests. They do not only address the concerns started earlier but they also streamlines the guest process. With contactless biometrics, guests are quickly and easily identified upon arrival, reducing the time and hassle of repetitive registrations and check-ins. 

            <br> <br>
            Based on my research, the following benefits have been identified in implementing contactless biometrics. <br>

            <center> <a href="img/gu4.png" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Benefits of facial recognition "> <img class="img-fluid mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" width="100%"src="img/gu4.png" alt=""></a> <center><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="font-size: 12px;"><br>Benefits of facial recognition</center>
</center>
                </p>
                </p>  

            <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">
              <b><br>Proposed guest experience<br></b>

              With all of that research and analysis conducted, I now crafted the proposed experience for Guests in the building.<br><br>
              To begin here is the main users or stakeholders of the process <br>
                1) Guests - users to be registered the system for identification and access to the building<br>
                2) Employees - invites guests to the building <br>
              <br> 

            The employee simply invites the guest via Google Calendar, and this will automatically send an email to the Guest s/he invited. The system should be able to detect if the email address is outside the organization and if the person has created an account already before. <br><br>

            <center> <a href="img/gu7.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Sample calendar invite "> <img class="img-fluid mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" src="img/gu7.jpg" width="50%" alt=""></a> <a href="img/gu8.png" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Email notification of guest registration "> <img class="img-fluid mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" src="img/gu8.png" width="40%" alt=""></a> 

                <center><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="font-size: 12px;"><br>Sample calendar invite and email notification of guest registration</center>
                    </center>
          </p> <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">

            The system is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward to use. When the Guest clicks on the registration link provided in the email, they are redirected to the registration system, where they fill out a short form with their personal details and complete their face ID registration. The system also provides reminders of what to expect on the day of the appointment. Guests can easily view all their upcoming appointments in a simple profile view.

 <br><br>

            The guest experience is made even more convenient with automatic notifications sent via email and mobile number. Reminders will be sent before or on the day of the appointment to ensure that guests don't forget about it. A few hours before their appointment, guests will receive a notification to accomplish the health check form. The system also alerts the employee if the guest has not completed their registration, allowing them to follow up and ensure that everything is in order before the appointment. Overall, this system makes the registration process easy and straightforward for guests, while ensuring that all necessary health and security measures are in place.

            <center> <a href="img/gu.mp4" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Guest management system screens "> <img class="img-fluid mb-4" style="margin-bottom: 0px !important;" src="img/gu.mp4" alt=""></a> <center><p class="text-muted mb-5" style="font-size: 12px;"><br>Guest management system screens</center>
             </center>
 </p> <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">

            Upon arrival, guests check-in via a kiosk where their face is quickly identified. In the rare case that facial recognition does not work, the guest can still enter the premises by entering their meeting ID, which the system verifies against its records to confirm the guest's identity and appointment.  <br><br>

            By only allowing registered guests with a scheduled appointment to enter, the system ensures enhanced security measures are in place, ensuring a worry-free experience for both guests and employees.


  <p class="text-muted mb-5" style="color:black!important;">
              <b style="font-size:16px;color:black!important;"><br>Project takeaways<br></b>

            As the lead of the guest experience research project, I learned the importance of understanding the current process and the people involved before introducing any new technology solutions.
            In order to effectively implement new technology, it is crucial to first <mark> address any current process issues and to utilize research </mark> to fully understand the guest experience. 
                <br><br>

            As UX practitioners, we must always go back to knowing who are users are. The best way to do this is to <mark> directly talk to those involved. </mark>
                <br><br>
         Additionally, introducing new technology can often raise concerns, however, thorough <mark> research on current global standards </mark> and actually understanding more about it can actually prove to be a highly effective solution for addressing pain points. 
                <br><br>

             Ultimately, <mark> the future of our industry lies in embracing technology</mark>, and I am personally excited to continue exploring innovative solutions that can enhance more of our business processes in the near future.
