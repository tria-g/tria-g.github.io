                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Founded in 1994, the Ateneo Management Information Systems Association is now on it 25th year in pursuing its main advocacy – social transformation through information management. Through the organization’s continuous efforts, we strive to carry on this advocacy through the next generations who will inform, form, and to transform the society.
                       </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        In light of this, as there would be no YEP this year to close off the semester we have come up with another medium not only to end the year but also to celebrate a milestone for the organization and recount its last 25 years of service in 125 seconds. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        This has been the 25th MISA Board of Executives and the Associates, and together, let us continue to build tomorrow through business technology.

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        As the last project for the academic year, I wanted to properly end my term with a promotion that would commemorate and encapsulate not only the BETA 1920 signing off but also the closing of the 25th year anniversary of the organization. Given as well that the year was cut short due to the suspensions caused by the pandemic, it would be best to use the digital medium to still let the organization’s presence be known through promotions such as this.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My main concept of the video was simply to showcase the 25 years that the organization has gone through in a short video that the members would easily watch when they see it online. Thinking of how 25 would be an essential number for the post plus emphathizing to an user's tendency to skip over long videos, I decided to slap on having the video in only 125 seconds (approx. 2 minutes).
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                         For pre-production, the difficulty was simply to gather all the footages from the past years. There weren’t much as most documentations were photos, therefore, the earliest video I could find dated 2009. Despite this limitation, I proceeded with my plan to show the 2009-2020 clips of Ateneo MISA. I disregarded the need to create a storyboard, and simply gathered the necessary resources (all footages I could find and the main background audio), since I didn't want any voiceover so that the videos would simply speak for itself of the years that has gone by for the organization.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My editing style for this video became sort of impromptus, despite the original plan of having a skeletal flow from the earliest to the latest date of MISA videos, sort-of like a timeline throughout the years. Having the limitation of videos dating only from 2009 (and not really 1994), I didn't feel that the timeline montage would matter, thus I eventually relied on the audio I could find from the videos, which mainly centered on the people  of MISA. Now, what I really just wanted to show was who we were in the span of 25 years.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        I made the central design style of the video as a vintage-tape kind of feel in order to give a nostalgic feeling for the audience by adding film textures, mellow electronic music, vintage computer sounds, filtered narrations, and vhs-like video colorings. This video was for the members in the past, the members that are about to leave, the members that are left behind, and the future members of MISA. This is to show Ateneo MISA, so far.

                       <p style="text-align:justify">
                        FOR 90 years, The GUIDON has committed itself to providing its readers with accurate and engaging content, made accessible through newsstands across the campus. After the publication launched its online platforms in 2008, it has steadily begun to delve into the world of digital journalism. Looking towards the future, The GUIDON hopes to fully transition into an online publication by its 100th year.

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        For the celebration of the 90 years of the publication, The GUIDON wanted to release an interactive article regarding their slow transition towards an online one in the coming year. I was then tasked to design the interactive without any prior website pegs given, and simply just the article at hand with a few suggested animations of their liking.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        With that, I had to research on possible pegs for the Interactive. What I suddenly remembered was people reacting to the Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/" target="_blank">Macbook</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ph/iphone-11-pro/" target="_blank">iPhone 11 Pro</a> websites before. A lot of users were astonished by how the product was presented with the use of a simple scroll function to go through the website. Therefore, I decided to present the article the same way. (Note: Some desired transitions that were supposed to mimic the ones from the Apple websites like the laptop zooming out or the search bar sticking to the top of the laptop weren't reflected in the final website, but seen in the Figma prototype, due to development limitations. However, the final transitions done were still approved and checked upon with my developer counterpart.)
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        I simply used the default The GUIDON Typeface in their usual articles as well as the official The GUIDON palettes. Gradients of The GUIDON colors were used in order for the colors to not be together with touches of red-orange-violet shades as an adjustment made to a feedback regarding the colors used initially to be plain and limited.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        To start off the interactive, I wanted the reader to immediately understand what the following article would be about. I made an expanding search bar animation to present the title, which immediately transitions to the laptop illustration to encapsulate the main idea of The GUIDON Online. This follows through with the rest of the article with graphics such as the phone graphic, vectorized illustrations, and other The GUIDON images used. 
                        </p>

                        In order for it to be a succesful interactive, I must then find a way for the user to simply not just feel they are reading a plain article full of just words . Aside from the animated transitions done throughout the article through scrolling, for the pros and cons section, which was just presented in the plain text as a table, I decided to separate each point to not only give emphasis but to also enable more scroll interaction between the website and the user.

                        To further add to the engagement of the users, instead of the static visual graphic suggested by the writers for the quotes for the future application, I presented these in a way that the users are able to voluntarily click on the features of the layout in order to see the quote (as seen below). This does not only add to the user's interactive experience while reading the article, but it also gives emphasis and importance to what is in store for the publication. By highlighting this interactive in the article, a user is able to have a taste of what Guidon plans for its app in the future.

                        For this work, the client simply sent me a copy of their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeAreLeads/videos/288214318722174/?v=288214318722174" target="_blank">old travel video</a> as a general peg and a hard drive containing all their raw footages from South Korea. The instructions from the client were simple and clear: "I have this bunch of raw vids and i just need someone to edit them into a decent travel vid." With that, I wanted to make a travel video that showed the company's incentive and how they were able to make it memorable for the people during the trip.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        To start, I researched for a Korean song that was simple short but with a happy chill style to it. I wanted the footages to be accompanied with a feel-good song that wasn't too long or too unfamiliar sounding for to the ears of the viewers. I viewed the many videos I was given and selected a few that would be perfect to put into a 2 minute video. I started with a scene which were the travelers in their natural state during the trip: talking about the very very cold weather yet at the same time enthusiastically grateful for the experience given by the company. It was an appropriate start to a video that showcased the trip they had experienced. Then comes the intro of the landscapes with a zoom in transitions, the clips of the food, and all of the adventures they did during the trip. I also found a clip testimonial to show right before the video ends, to effectively show the trip was effective and full of joy. After a few more effects and transitions, the video ends with the group cheering for the company in multiple locations. It ends by leaving the viewer the thought of how the South Korea trip wouldn't be experienced by the group if it weren't for the opportunity given by the company.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        This annual project by the Communication Cluster was made to present the board of the executives and the associates for that academic year. It was the main medium for the people behind the organization to be known and recognized by the members. Similar to how I started it last year when I was an AVP, I planned to create videos for the clusters, profile photos for each officer, an album showing all of BETA, and additional new teaser to start the project. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My AVPs and I gathered pegs already for the <a href="https://imgur.com/r/exo/f8gee">photoshoot</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwugc-DRbSok" target="_blank">videos</a> to be done. We aspired to highlight the <b>brand of the organization</b> (especially following its rebranding) through our colors and business tech image, but at the same time show the personal side of each member of the BETA.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the photoshoot, we went for a curtain like setup for the photoshoot with the use of the teal color with an accompanying blue color. The use of the stool, chair, and couch against the cloth background was to have a minimalistic feel to the photo as well as to highlight the BETA officer itself without any additional component in the shot. The props were also all dark grey as it is one of MISA's primary colors and it is in contrast against the light cloth of the background. A while cloth is messily placed at the bottom of the seats for added texture and color in the photos.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        This simple setup were highlighted in most of the promos through the behind-the-scenes style. The backdrop of the setup itself were also used in the teaser graphic and for the Instagram filler covers. To further give emphasis on the overall simplicity of the theme, in the spiels, Simply BETA, Simply MISA were used as taglines well.

                        Each member were to wear anything white that is smart-casual, to show the image of formality but at the same relaxed, as what the org should be. All 24 members was also given the choice to select the particular prop they want to use: stool, chair, or even the couch (although this was only done for the president).

                        For the group  photos, my AVPs and I decided to have both formal and casual shots. The casual shots contain props that would help understand what that particular cluster does. The layout of the photos are placed against a white background with the text underneath for simplicity and elegance.

                        Next up are the videos. There were 4 videos in total with two offices/clusters per video. Each video focuses on a central theme in order to learn something about the members of those clusters. The topics of the videos focused on their goals, favorites, wishes, and memories (Stylized as "My Goals" ) The output to be done is similar to this peg which lets the person answer the question in short answers in a sit down shot, while at the same time showing footages of the behind-the-scenes of the photoshoot once again.

                        Every Christmas season, there are some Filipinos who may see the holidays as just another ordinary working day. The GUIDON explores some of their stories through this interactive.

                      <p style="text-align:justify">
                          After having the DesignCon with the writers, developer, graphic artist, and their executive counter parts regarding the interactive, the general description of the article to be made was having to show those who still have to work during Christmas amidst the national holiday. The team wanted to have an interactive that will show the Christmas spirit but at the same time highlight the stories of those to be interviewed. They (the writers) shared their ideas for design presentation such as a Christmas tree with colored Christmas balls relating to their work colors or the ornaments being the actual job that they do (like a car for the transportation service) with a side popup to be showed when hovered or even a redirect to a new page, and other suggestions. After that meeting, it was still up to me on how the Interactive will be presented. Thus, considering their suggestions, the purpose of the website, which is to show the life of the workers, and the appropriate interface for the user, I ended up with a general profile for the interactive, together with the rough sketch made by my graphic artist partner.
                      </p> <br>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                         It is a normal Christmas setup, showing its spirit and vibe through warm colors. However, in the tree would be outshining Christmas Balls, that if clicked, will overlay the actual articles. For the ornament design, I came up with the combination of the two suggestions by simply putting the <i> worlds </i> of the worker inside the Christmas Ball, and when clicked, it will allow the user to experience their "worlds" by entering them in order to realize the reality of how the holiday is for the workers.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the user to easily understand the website, we decided to add instructions at the bottom of the page so that they know that they are supposed to scroll and click on the ornaments.
                    </p> <br>
                     <img src="img2/xmas4.jpg" loading="lazy" width=100%>

                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        What I also did was to add this hover option, wherein the names and jobs of the interviewed will be placed. It also adds to better user experience as they would know what the ornament drawing is trying to portray and at the same time they have already a short <i> entrance </i> to what they will be reading. I made it into a christmas present tag that highlights against the dark opacity background. The fact that the user has to voluntarily click on the ornaments to view the stories, also adds to the interaction between the user and the website, aside from them just reading an article.
                    </p> <br>
                    <video  autoplay loop> <source src="vid/xmas.mp4" type="video/mp4" loading="lazy"/> </video>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        With that, the interactive was able to present the real life elves of Santa also known as these hardworking Filipinos interviewed (and the rest of the people who work tirelessy each day despite the holidays), and through this well-deserved their recognition, we are able to celebrate the true spirit of Christmas by letting their stories be heard.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the 25th year of the organization, the logo and overall branding of Ateneo MISA was revamped to effectively promote the org by forming a brand image that is more modern and appropriate for the current society to properly advocate the orgs values and core competency: social transformation through information management.
                       </p>
                        <br />
                        <p style="text-align:justify">

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        As the Vice President of Communications 2019-2020, what I have noticed is that the organization’s logo seems outdated and inconsistent with the branding that the organization is trying to portray. I wanted to make sure that I will be able to slowly incorporate the needed changes for the image of the org during my term. It was also just right that it was the 25th year of the organization, thus, celebrating the milestone of the org with the rebranding done. 

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        To properly accomplish the rebranding, I evaluated what the organization currently has as image. There were three main aspects of MISA’s brand: teal, hexagons, and the robot mascot (MISA Bot). To start, prior my term as both AVP then VP, the latter has already been changed into a friendly vector illustration of the mascot, therefore, there was no changes to be done with that, but instead there was then a need to make the logo fitting with this earlier change of mascot style as well as a clearer definition of the organization's brand. What I focused then was the two former elements mentioned, since these two were the symbols that you will instantly remember when you hear the name of the organization, thus I did not want to stray away from that strong and stable figure association already made in the 25 years of MISA. The current logo had a rugged text of the words MISA, with the long title at the bottom, and outlined hexagon logo that come in teal, black, and white. The logo is fitting to the old mascot of the organization, I must say, but it does look outdated and too technical because of the choice of font. Also, the outlined hexagons and the single dark hues of the colors used made the image of the organization dull and sluggish to what MISA actually is.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        With that, what I wanted for the rebranding can be divided intro <b>three main insights</b>:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        1) Maintain the curent brand recall of the organization
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        2) Showcasing the values and identity of the organization
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        3) Have a more modern and friendlier interconnected image
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        To address the first and second reasons, I started with the things that I <b>didn't </b>want to change, the teal and hexagons. I did not want to change the three hexagons because of how MISA has already created a big brand out of these three and also how it stood for the three core values of the organization: Excellence, Servant Leadership, and Professionalism. Also, as the home org of MIS majors, I still wanted to higlight the origin of it all, our course, MIS.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Proceeding still with the second one and introducing the third reason, as the organization is both focused on Business and Techology, there is then a need to change the font of the logo as it seems to <i> technical </i> to the eyes as it has rugged edges. The change of the text to Montserrat, an elegant smooth font, would not only be pleasing to look at as it is modernized well-designed web font, but it allows one to see the org's business technology side. It is also noted how the current logo's hexagons had sharp edges, it is part of UI design that rounded edges are "easier on the eyes than a rectangle with sharp edges because they take less cognitive effort to visually process," (<a href="https://medium.com/@carolinalina/how-to-design-ui-buttons-that-convert-d5ebb1080969" target="_blank">Article</a>) with this taken into account, as a designer and given that MISA also does Web Development services (thus advocating proper UX/UI as well), I made the hexagons have rounded edges to appear friendlier to the viewer and also to show how the organization has this kind of friendly attitude to its members as well, amidst its formality in nature. 
                        </p>
                        <br><img src="img2/rb2.jpg" loading="lazy" width=90%>
                       <center>  <p style="color: #AAAAAA"> Draft logos </p></center>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        The Communications VP for 2018-2019 or the one before me, also expressed before how dark the teal used in our logo (or brand) is. Remembering this and wanting to make the new brand more modern and friendlier as stated in the third reason, I made the teal a bit brighter and also in gradient. Not only has it been a trend recently, but the comibination of the two to three shades of teal gives life to the brand of the organization. As gradients allow the image to be "memorable, unique, realistic, and colorful" (<a href="https://medium.muz.li/why-gradients-are-the-new-colors-3d8d42a7a6fc9" target="_blank">Article</a>), it allows the viewer to see the image of the org with more depth. The change in logo in general also makes the current mascot (which. as mentioned above, has been revamped already) be more fitting and connected with each other. It helps a member of the org understand what the org is trying to portay: a business technology organization that is firm to its advocacies yet a family to its members. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        From these identified factors above as well as having constant consultation with my Associate Vice Presidents and fellow Executive Board members, I ended up with the following rebranding.
                        </p>
                        <br><img src="vid/nl2.mp4" width=100%>

                        <center>  <p style="color: #AAAAAA"> Made with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Efects </p></center>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        The logo comes with three variations the wide primary, medium tall, and small icon in teal, dark grey, and white. Plus, an additional one color small icon logo and a default image logo for profile photos. I decied to have versions of the logo so that it can elevate the organization's brand more through having options that can be used depending on the type of medium it will be placed on. For this year's rebranding, the organization also released its t-shirt merchandise for its 25th year featuring the new logo.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Through the use of the rounded hexagons, gradient teal, and a sans-serif typeface, the rebranding was able to <b> transform a flat, outdated, stiff, and a too ‘technical-like’ kind of design into a modern friendly elegant with color dimension </b> that is still familiar and ideal for a business technology organzation made for society transformation.

                       Every day our actions are influenced by our upbringing, media, and most importantly, culture. Though distinct in lifestyle, Koreans and Filipinos are connected by the whole experience of living or being a person. As students, learning about each other's lifestyles serve as an aid to the connection we have with one another. We learn to understand and show appreciation for the kind of culture each grew up to live in. Learning opens the window between two cultures, allowing us to bond. Through time, it becomes easier to see that there is beauty that resides on both sides of the window.

                        </p>
                        <p>When I first learned about the theme, which focuses on the celebration of friendship between Korea and the Philippines, from then on I wanted to show how despite the differences in culture, there is still unity and connection between the two. </p>

                        <p>Working on the screenplay, I remember seeing this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shinliart/" target="_blank">account</a> showing a couple from United States and Korea comparing how they perform their routine daily. It reflects how there is truly a huge difference between the way they perform their tasks, but there still that similarity of the fact that they are simply just two individuals going through each day. With that, I wanted to present my video the same way: two different perspectives of life one inspired by the Korean culture and another simply living the Filipino culture.</p>

                        <p>Together with the two points of view peg, given that we are both in college, I also decided to do the routine based on how we are as students in the university. The video goes through our normal school day, with I, as the one focusing on the Philippine Culture, while my partner (who is really a Korean Pop fan) reflected the Korean Culture. The video starts from the moment we wake up until the day ends, with us celebrating our friendship during our Korean Language Class, where we help each other and simply enjoy each other's company. Working on the script, I wanted to further exemplify the two varying cultures, by using those two languages only throughout the video.</p>


                        <p>Ultimately, the video is able to show the diversity yet its unity in the process. It makes the viewer realize that language and personal preferences does not hinder friendship. It makes you realize that we aren't so different after all.</p>

                        As an UX/UI Design Intern in GroupM, this was one of the prototypes assigned for us to do. In the creation of this study, there is the lingering risk and uncertainty as it is a new application to be introduced by the client to the public causing the application to be designed from scratch. To deal with this challenge, a competitive audit, research, and brand analysis, were made accomplished as discussed in the rationale below:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">

                        For this specific design, the Airbnb and Globe Rewards applications were used as a guide for its layout and content. These two were respectively regarded as basis given that: First, Airbnb has an interface that is not only aesthetically simple and pleasing for the users but it is also of ease to use for most individuals in the millennial community, which is the target market presented in the quantum deck. Second, the Globe Rewards is an existing application that has a similar goal to the requested app, which is to showcase rewards and promos to its subscribers. The prototype was then matched to the standards of this specific app that has the same end goal to ensure value for its future users.

                        The gold and dark grey color scheme of the prototype illustrates a sophisticated and elegant appearance in order to cater to the application’s elite target market. The thin and regular fonts of Helvetica Neue were used all throughout the prototype to maintain the elegance of the interface.

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        The prototype includes a bottom navigation bar to establish an easy navigation of pages throughout the use of the app. The layout of the perks and rewards in the app were organized in a way that it would make the user feel that each of it is worthy of a great deal. These are divided into <b>navigation items </b>wherein the user is able to: 
                        <p>1) Explore perks and rewards near its location </p>
                        <p>2) Discover perks and rewards based on the user’s preference and history</p>
                        <p>3) Search promos and rewards in their own time. </p> 

                        <p>These aspects were considered to cater the user’s experience during the app. It is evident in applications like Airbnb, Zomato, etc. that users are able to conveniently look for a value based on their location, choices, or feelings.

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        In the search function, the user will be able to filter out the expected results by the latest to the oldest and vice versa, by the most expensive to the least and vice versa, and by category. It is also to be noted how the perks are presented first than the rewards to gratify the use of the application as these promos are exclusively for the subscriber with no transaction needed. For each perk and reward selected, the user is able to redeem the selected item, save it into his/her calendar for future use or gift it to someone else. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        A noted addition to the prototype is the aspect that exceeds usual mobile application interaction, which is gamification. The middle and most noticeable button found in the navigation bar is the infinity sign logo of the program. Once the button is triggered, it brings out the screen of a slot machine. The user is then able to use this simple game once a day wherein they have the chance to be able to win special rewards. This feature was made to entice the users to use the application on a daily basis. A slot machine game was chosen since the use of casinos and the like, match the gold and dark vibe of the application seemingly pertaining to popular contemporary luxurious themes like Luhrmann’s 2013 film of the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/vickiegonzales/great-gatsby-party/" target="_blank">“The Great Gatsby.”</a> This activity is also often associated as that of a high class activity as it is always located in fancy hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions, thus fitting for the overall target of the application.

                        Other features of the proposed application includes a hamburger menu which shows to the user’s profile details as well as links to other necessary components of the application. A chat bot is also part of the prototype, as requested by the client, in a familiar layout similar to that of any chatting applications. In addition to this bot is the option to directly contact someone from the Concierge. The Infinity Badge was also translated into a QR code, since this is the most efficient and modern way to scan or access your account in any store. For easy access, users are simply to login through the biometrics feature to enter the application. However, a login page using a password is also included in the application.

                        <p>Given that the website is mainly focused on one purpose, I was able to effectively disseminate the information needed for the user through the layout and design constructed. The inclusion of the outage map and safety tips checklist now become the call to actions of the users upon access. However the website’s simplicity also appeared as a limitation as there was no other function or feature that can be added that will be deemed necessary. Therefore, the prototype study mainly focuses on the actual purpose of the website for a user who wants to know any of the important updates regarding an emergency’s situation: <b>what happened, what is being done by Meralco, and what do we do.</b></p>
                        <p> Aside from being able to view the Outage Map, I made sure to add the related articles linking to other news websites since as a resident under an emergency, it is most likely that the user woud like to know more about the situation. This adds to a better experience of the user when the website is up and running. Additionally, to add user interaction, for the safety tips, it is presented as some sort of checklist that the users can check when understood, done, or practiced. </p>

                        Blue, yellow, and red. Everyone knows these as the primary sources of any color combination that we see in our everyday lives. The three colors bring out the brightness, calmness, and most importantly the beauty of life’s varied shades and hues. I focused on these colors and made them the central theme of the video. Featuring the wondrous streets and sceneries of both South Korea and the Philippines, the video is an observation of how both nations incorporate blues, yellows, and reds into their cultures. It is through these that we can see how, despite the existence of uniqueness, there is a strong connection in their similarities. Unity arises not only through the vibrant primary colors but also the parallelisms of both countries, wherein the Korean influence is now heavily integrated in the lives of Filipinos. Blue, yellow and red also signify the countries’ political identities, appearing in the Philippine flag and Korea’s tricolored 태극기 (taegeukgi).

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> For my video piece in this contest, I felt the need to show the how the current relationship of my country, the Philippines, is with South Korea through the most vibrant way possible: the use of colors. I focused on the three primary colors, red, blue, and yellow, because of how these three make up all the other colors that we see. (And additionally, a bonus meaning, the three colors are commonly significant in both traditions as mentioned in the description above.)</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        Given this concept, I was then able to apply how the Korean culture has greatly impacted our own by adding more shades of these colors into what we experience, making it livelier and more beautiful. But, our own culture still shines through beside that of the Korean nation. We also see through these colors the likeness we have as nations, that despite our differences, there is still the connection seen in the two cultures through the spectrum that we both see in our daily lives. The three colors make up each country individually, but together, the cultures are able to complement each other by providing different yet familiar shades and hues for one to experience.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> I was a late addition to the project since the previous designer left. That person had created old designs for both branding and UI, unfortunately, receiving criticism in terms of the design colors, layout, etc., as it was not fit for the proper user exeperience. With that, I decided to start from scratch and not simply edit the previous designer’s work but recreate it to a more minimalistic and modern design perfect for computer e-commerce business brand. </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> I started off with the branding and logo. I sadly did not have direct communication with the client since I was an extra addition, but our messages and ideas were relayed to the original team members. The client did not really have any idea for what they want also for the logo, except for it to have the color blue and something related to the computer. With that, after research and knowning more about the brand/product, I came up with three initial logos, in relation to the computer aspect of the brand. After consultation and feedback, we ended up with this final branding. </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> After which is the User Interface for the website itself. Given that it is an E-commerce website, there were really a lot of pages needed for this, for all buyers, sellers, services, and admins. Upon the continuous communication with my three fellow developers and the clients, here are the screens that I have come up with. </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> Since e-commerce websites like Shopee and Lazada are mostly used in today’s time, I had researched upon those websites as basis for the prototype. This is important since the buyer for this e-commerce would most likely be familiar with these famous websites at the moment, thus, the user should experience the same feel and familiarity in the prototype as well.  </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> Additionally, Amazon was also used as basis as there is a wide array of electronics, gadgets, and computer-related products found in that website, which can be the closest market to Compee’s. This was also the only website peg given by the client, as they had said to make the website “<i>seem legit</i>.” </p>

                        My old school contacted me regarding a video project they wanted to make. Given the current pandemic, they wanted to make use of the online platform as a way to still be there for the students. Thus, the guidance department of Assumption Antipolo in collaboration with Communitails to create videos with therapy dogs.

                        The Guidance Counselors gave me a rough script and flow of the filming that we will be doing. On the day of the filming, together with two of my friends (aka production assistants in that case) ran around following Ramen, the therapy dog, for hours to tour around the school for the video. With that, the dog video editing begins! Due to the length of the video, you can watch the video for the first installment <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=330298191429011&ref=external" target="_blank">here</a> instead.

                        The second installment of the Ramen series feautured her other dog therapy friends. This video focuses on the reality of the online learning classes, seen in the perspective of the dogs. Featuring animations and self-filmed videos from the owners, the final video showcased the current learning environment in a cute and fun manner!

                       <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        Since, of course, Ramen can’t talk, her persona and mood should be portrayed through the editing of the video. I did this by adding the doggy talking subtitles (editing and adjusting the script given by the Guidance Counselors to me), fun music, photo and video pop ups, and then fun emoticons to go with her videos. The video’s main value was to give joy towards the students, especially the little ones, in the midst of the suspension of classes. Just like how the dog has given the students therapy during regular classes, through the video, the same kind of comfort or joy from the cuteness should still be felt and experienced when watching the videos.

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> A small dessert shop I started with my friend who is passionate about baking. I worked on the overall branding of the business as well as all promotions (which includes posters, animation, product shoots, copywriting, etc.), creative direction, social media handling and strategies for the brand.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">  This personality is further emphasized by the creation of our mascot named Bella Bear (with the same initials of BB as the brand name) to put together the cute aspect of our image. Our posts are always vibrant in color as we aim to provide joy to everyone. This is done to add more abundance and creative freedom but at the same time speak about our liveliness as a brand.</p>


                         <p style="text-align:justify"> Given that there will be a lot of competitors, we try our best to constantly promote our business through fun ads to show our personality to our future customers. For our posts, the main focus are our products itself, while these are accompanied with copy that has a friendly tone to it. </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> The stories feature in our accounts is  maximized in order for the customers to see that the business is not only active but also the fact that we are just three-man-team behind the brand through and present to them the scenes behind what we do. </p>

                         <p style="text-align:justify"> Lastly, to further express our brand value and image the users should experience this when interacting with this. Since we want to have a friendly cute image, we assure that when we reply to them in all of their inquiries, we are jolly and accomodating. We also make sure as well to highlight their feedback and always give spotlight to them. </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify"> As always, I started the branding project by letting the client answer my branding design form. This is to further understand what direction we should be doing for the brand's design.</p>

                        4) What key words would you like your brand to be associated with?
                        </p>
                         <p style="text-align:justify">
                        5) List down 1-2 Close Competitors

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        6) If rebranding, what made your team decide that you should already rebrand?

                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> Additionally, the clients gave me a Pinterest board to work with as I create my design. After analzying and searching for what path I should be going with the brand's identity, I crafted a Google slides to present to the client. In this presentation, it included the brand summary/details and the design deliverables created such as the moodboard, brand word bank, brand personas, and brand studies.  </p>

                         <p style="text-align:justify"> The client specifically preferred logo study #4. They wanted to be different from the usual orange/red color palette of the restaurants and wanted a black/pink scheme to their brand. After a few revisions and adjustments, we've come up with the final logo of Busog.  </p>
                         <br> <center><img src="img2/b3.png" loading="lazy" width=45%> <img src="img2/b4.png" loading="lazy" width=45%></center>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> The logo highlights the letter B with the use of a bold font, to stand for the meaning of busog which is "to be full." The incorporation of the utensils in the brand's initial highlights the main service of the restaurant, which is to serve you good food. The additional bowl element tells us of the kind of food that is served in the restaurant. This includes stews, specifically the traditional Balbacua, a Filipino beef stew, which the client really wanted to highlight more in the restaurant. </p>

To make things easier I created a Google Forms questionnare for the intial questions I had in mind. After which, I can talk more to the client for additional information and questions to further understand to who I am designing for.This was the first time I was doing this for a client so I wanted to try it out if it would be effective to have it in a form presented neatly.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> Thankfully, the client was very nice and organized and actually sent me the answers in a memorandum! I was then given a huge background about the information and history of the restaurant, thus, I really understood what they have done so far and what their idea of the future of their business is. I was then able to compile all the needed information to know more about the business from the memo and from talking to the client. Afterwards, I asked for the pegs they wanted so far and since they gave a lot, I divided it into the kinds of logos they sent.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> Honestly, their pegs were diverse from each other, and as mentioned, they sent a lot so I was kind of overwhelmed at first as to what direction I should go for. With further consultation as well with the client, there wasn't any specific element that they wanted for it. I had a run down of <b>15+ logo drafts</b>. After constant feedback and conservations with the client, they simply wanted for the logo to be brighter yet still have the same subliminal element in it like their previous one. This continued until we finally had the logo that suited for the brand.</p>

I wa tasked to create these using an stronaut cartoon under the “Let’s get AstroPhysical Series” and choosing the “Milky Way” theme because of the product being Cereal Milk Flavor, with the brand being fun, fit, and glowing. Aside from these astronaut stickers, in both one-colored and fully colored verions, an additional milk carton graphic was made as well as the layout poster brochure for the actual shaker.</p>
